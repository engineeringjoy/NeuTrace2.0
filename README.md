NeuTrace2.0 is a set of macros/scripts for manually tracing neuronal processes from image files in image j and analyzing the resulting straighened views in Python. The original version of this code was written as part of my dissertation work under the mentorship of Dr. Miriam Goodman, Stanford University. The Python code was originally adapted from Peak_Finder code written by Dr. Alka Das. Many changes were made to adapt her code, which was originally used to analyze neurites in adult C. elegans, but peak detection approach is the same as used in Katta...Goodman, 2019 {Provide PMID and link.}

More instructions to be added later.
